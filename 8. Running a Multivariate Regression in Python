# Since p-values of the explanatory variables from the above cases are different (rise/drop significantly), we cannot confirm they can influence the price of a house. However, it serves some good guidance for future research. Here are some points we could conculde from the findings:
# 1. Gather more data above observations. As the p-values of "House Size" and "Number of Rooms" might decrease, but since the R-Square is as high as 0.683, it is not necessary for us to gather more data then.
# 2. "House Size" and "Number of Rooms" could be related.
# 3. Gather data about more explanatory variables.
# Therefore, Regressions can give us a good direction for future research. Regression analysis can be invaluable when we study the past to predict future behavior!
